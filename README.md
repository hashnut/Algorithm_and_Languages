## BFS

Breadth-First-Search

**Used for vertices closer to the given source & unweighted graph**

Time complexity : 
 1. O(V+E) : When adjacency list is used
 2. O(V^2) : When adjacency matrix is used


---

## DFS

**Used for vertices far from the given source & disjoint set**

Time complexity : 
 1. O(V+E) : When adjacency list is used
 2. O(V^2) : When adjacency matrix is used

## Union-Find

# Graph

Graph algorithms, including `shortest distance` and `MST`

<br><br/>

## Dijkstra 

**[Find shortest distance from the starting point](https://yabmoons.tistory.com/364)**
> Doesn't work when there is negative-weighted edge

Time complexiey : 
 1. O(N^2) : Naive visit (traverse all nodes and edges)
 2. O(NlogN) : Using priority queue

<br><br/>

## Bellman-Ford 

**[Find shortest distance from the starting point]()**
> Doesn't work when there is negative cycle
> Also used to check if there is negative cycle

Time complexity : O(V\*E)
